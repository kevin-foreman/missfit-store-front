# Missfit Store Front

## Description
An Full-Stack React e-commerce store front for the missfits' merch. Built to house products represented by the group. The application requires users to authenticate an account using email credentials, and provide a password for access to sensitive information in order to make orders, and get items from the shop. User passwords are hashed with additional salt rounds, and is one-way encrypted so it can be stored in the database, and attributed to each individual user.
